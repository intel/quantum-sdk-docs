Circuit Printing & LaTeX
-------------------------

To invoke the circuit printer, user the ``-P`` flag:

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./intel-quantum-compiler -P console quantum_algorithm.cpp
   $ ./intel-quantum-compiler -P tex quantum_algorithm.cpp
   $ ./intel-quantum-compiler -P json quantum_algorithm.cpp

For each ``quantum_kernel`` function in the source code compiled, the circuit printer
feature will output a representation of the quantum kernel to the target
specified. The ``console`` target will result in ascii-style circuits
being displayed to the console. The ``tex`` and ``json`` targets will output,
for each ``quantum_kernel`` function, a separate ``.tex`` or ``.json`` file.

A TeX distribution on your local machine with the ``qcircuit`` package
(maintained at the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN)) and its
dependencies are required to produce an image or PDF file from the ``.tex``
file. Many options for TeX distributions exist for each platform. Those familiar
with the LaTeX typesetting language will be able to incorporate the ``.tex``
file or part of its contents into their projects. Those familiar with the
commands of the ``qcircuit`` package may customize and extend the diagram at
will.
