To read about individual components of the |IQSDK|, see
the accompanying documents |DGR|, |Tutorials|, |FLEQ| and |API|.

To explore examples included with the |IQSDK|, look in the
``/<path to IQSDK>/quantum_examples/`` and
``/<path to IQSDK>/python-quantum-examples/`` directories.

Fundamentals

To find out more about the core concepts of quantum computing, such as qubit
mathematics or quantum circuit representations, we recommend using a
textbook such as

1. "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Nielsen and Chuang :cite:p:`NiCh10`.
2. "Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists" by Yanofsky and Mannucci :cite:p:`YaMa08`.
3. "Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach" by Hidary :cite:p:`Hida19`.

To brush up on C++, we recommend the latest edition of "Tour of C++" by Bjarne
Stroustrup :cite:p:`Stro22`. In our code, we strive to adhere to the
`LLVM style standard <https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html#style-issues>`_
to simplify working with our APIs.
