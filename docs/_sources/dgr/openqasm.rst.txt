Support for OpenQASM 2.0
-------------------------

The |IQSDK| provides a source-to-source converter which takes OpenQASM
code and converts it into C++ for use with the |IQSDK|. This
converter requires Python 3; see |GettingStartedGuide:SystemReqs|
section for specifics and recommendations. Currently, it processes OpenQASM 2.0
compliant code as described by the Open Quantum Assembly Language paper
(`arXiv:1707.03429 [quant-ph] <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1707.03429>`_).

To translate an OpenQASM file to C++ file, you can run the compiler
with the ``-B`` flag to generate the corresponding ``quantum_kernel`` functions in C++
format.

.. code-block:: console

   $ ./intel-quantum-compiler -B example.qasm
